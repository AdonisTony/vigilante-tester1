## Overview
Vigilante is a 2D side-scrolling single-player RPG which offers gaming experience similar to Maplestory and The Elder Scrolls Series. The game features an intriguing vampire storyline, allowing the player to grow from a nobody eventually to a vampiric lord. It also provides plenty of maps, enemies, magics, and equipments to discover.

Similar to The Elder Scrolls series, the player can team up with certain NPCs and adventure together. The player can either take side with the huntsman guild and protect the world, or take side with the vampires and bring destruction to the world. The storyline will be tailored based on the player's playstyle.
